This is a simple application that keeps track of all your sources (i.e. books,
papers, articles). With this information at hand you can:

- Add comments and notes to any source to keep track of what you found more
  relevant from it.
- Tag sources and comments in the way you wish.
- Save searches that match on a user-defined tag, or a certain string from any
  of your comments.
- Export searches into CSV or TeX so it can be used for building up bibliography
  sections on a paper you might be working on.

The *workflow* revolves around the idea of being able to tag sources and
comments with tags that you might want to define, and then being able to list
sources with searches based on these tags.
